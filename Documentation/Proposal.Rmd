# Introduction

More and more open data is available nowadays. One example is the BRP, 'BasisRegistratie Percelen', where all the farmlands in the Netherlands are stored with their respectively crop type. Another example of open data are the spectral satellite imagery of the whole globe.

Farmers in the Netherlands do in general not know how well their crop is doing compared to other fields in the region. THerefore I want to build a tool where farmers can assess their field in comparison to other fields in the region.

# Method

The proposed method is:

- Download the BRP of the latest year.
- Extract the BRP data.
- Determine the centroid of every field.
- Fetch the NDVI value of each centroid of every field on <http://boerenbunder.nl> in CRS:RDnew.
- Rank every field based on their NDVI value in their respectively crop category.
- Visualize the results on a webpage using Leaflet.

To make this project feasonable only a small area of one municipality is used, this to simplify the project and reduce processing time.
